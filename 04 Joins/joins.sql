###-- JOIN --###
-- A join is a method of linking data between one (self join) or more tables based on values of the common column between the tables.
-- MySQL supports the following types of joins:
	## Inner join
	## Left join
	## Right join
	## Cross join
	## Self join

-- MySQL hasnâ€™t supported the FULL OUTER JOIN yet

###-- INNER JOIN --###
-- The INNER JOIN matches each row in one table with every row in other tables and allows you to query rows that contain columns from both tables.
-- inner joins eliminate rows from both tables that do not satisfy the join condition set forth in the ON statement. 
-- In mathematical terms, an inner join is the intersection of the two tables.
-- you can write INNER JOIN o just JOIN
-- use aliasing to help you shorten your code

-- company_permalink in this table maps to the permalink field in tutorial.crunchbase_companies
SELECT companies.permalink AS companies_permalink,
       acquisitions.company_permalink AS acquisitions_permalink
  FROM crunchbase.companies companies
 INNER JOIN crunchbase.acquisitions acquisitions
    ON companies.permalink = acquisitions.company_permalink

       AND acquisitions.price_amount != 0						    #Condition in ON Clause
WHERE country_code = 'USA';
-- query of the price of companies that have been acquired by other companies 
-- which the the amount of funding_total is bigger than acquired price
-- For INNER JOIN clause, the condition in the ON clause is equivalent to the condition in the WHERE clause.

###-- RIGHT JOIN --###
-- MySQL RIGHT JOIN is similar to LEFT JOIN, except that the treatment of the joined tables is reversed.
-- they return all rows from the table in the RIGHT JOIN clause and only matching rows from the table in the FROM clause.
-- RIGHT JOIN is rarely used because you can achieve the results of a RIGHT JOIN 
-- by simply switching the two joined table names in a LEFT JOIN.

-- This query
SELECT companies.permalink AS companies_permalink,
       companies.name AS companies_name,
       acquisitions.company_permalink AS acquisitions_permalink,
       acquisitions.acquired_at AS acquired_date
  FROM crunchbase.companies companies
  LEFT JOIN crunchbase.acquisitions acquisitions
    ON companies.permalink = acquisitions.company_permalink

-- produces the same results as this query:
SELECT companies.permalink AS companies_permalink,
       companies.name AS companies_name,
       acquisitions.company_permalink AS acquisitions_permalink,
       acquisitions.acquired_at AS acquired_date
  FROM crunchbase.acquisitions acquisitions
 RIGHT JOIN crunchbase.companies companies
    ON companies.permalink = acquisitions.company_permalink

-- another example from previos left join turn into right join

###-- SELF JOIN --###
-- To perform a self join, you must use table aliases to not repeat the same table name twice in a single query.
-- referencing a table twice or more in a query without using table aliases will cause an error.
-- you can perform SELF JOIN using INNER JOIN, LEFT KOIN, and RIGHT JOIN
